The standard Item Card in Dynamics 365 Business Central is excellent, but its ability to handle product visuals is limited to just one primary picture. For businesses with vast product catalogs, diverse color options, or complex assemblies, this single image is simply not enough.
A more robust, scalable, and dedicated solution involves creating a custom table to store your images and then displaying them in a dedicated FactBox on the Item Card.
